# Task Execution Guide

## Purpose

This file helps agents and less experienced developers work consistently in this repo.

## Default Workflow

### 1. Understand The Request

Identify:
- which page or section is affected
- whether the task is content, layout, refactor, SEO, media, or structure
- whether the task is static-page work or truly needs logic

### 2. Load Only The Needed Guidance

- read `AGENTS.md`
- read only the one or two relevant `.ai` files
- read `.ai/decisions/index.md` only if the task may change durable policy
- avoid reading unrelated docs

Examples:
- page structure -> `content-pages.md`
- SEO task -> `seo.md`
- Tailwind or Angular structure -> `code-style.md` and `architecture.md`
- tool choice -> `tooling.md`

### 3. Inspect Before Editing

- inspect the nearest existing page or section
- check layout and route patterns
- check how Tailwind and SCSS are already used
- preserve existing visual language unless redesign is requested

### 4. Make The Smallest Effective Change

- keep the scope tight
- prefer page-local implementation
- do not add abstractions unless they clearly improve reuse
- keep prerender compatibility intact

### 5. Review The Result

Check that:
- the page stays simple and readable
- mobile layout still makes sense
- SEO-relevant content is still visible in text
- no unnecessary complexity was added

### 6. Summarize Clearly

When done, summarize:
- what changed
- anything important to verify
- any follow-up worth noting
